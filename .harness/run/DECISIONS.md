# DECISIONS

> Your answers go here, never in `.harness/run/ESCALATION.md`. That file is the engine's own log —
> it may still be appending to it or rewriting it long after this file first appeared, because
> queuing a decision does not stop the run (the engine keeps working on everything else it can).
> Waiting for `ESCALATION.md` to exist is not the same as the engine having actually stopped, and a
> decision written into that file while the engine is still using it can be lost or half-read.
>
> This file is yours alone. The Runtime denies the engine both Edit and Write on it, mechanically —
> not by asking it nicely — so nothing you write here can ever race an engine write.
>
> For each entry you want to answer, copy its id from `ESCALATION.md` (e.g. `D-001`) as a heading
> below, and write your decision and rationale under it. The rationale joins the audit trail.
> The engine picks up every id present here at the **start** of its next Iteration, never mid-flight
> — so answer, save, and only then re-run. Wait for `Status: ESCALATE` in the run's output as your
> signal that it is safe to answer, not for this file or `ESCALATION.md` merely existing.

## D-001

**Approved as proposed** (2026-09-24). All 15 criteria and their Verification Classes stand unchanged: the 8 `machine` criteria as written, and all 7 `human` criteria (6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) accepted in full. Assumptions A-001 … A-006 are not overturned.

Rationale: the human reviewed the DoD and explicitly agreed to every `human` criterion. The run continues in Autonomous mode; no further questions are expected after this approval.
